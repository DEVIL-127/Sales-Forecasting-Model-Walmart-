# Sales Forecasting Model for Walmart

This project demonstrates how I improved forecasting accuracy by 20% using time series algorithms and deployed the model on AWS and GCP.

## Folder Structure:
- `data/`: Contains the sales dataset.
- `src/`: Contains the Python scripts for data preprocessing, model training, and model deployment.
- `notebooks/`: Contains the Jupyter notebooks for analysis.

## How to Run the Project:
1. Preprocess the data using `data_preprocessing.py`.
2. Train the model using `model_training.py`.
3. Deploy the model to AWS or GCP using `deploy_model.py`.
